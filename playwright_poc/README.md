# Playwright UI Automation Framework

This project automates key user flows for the [Petsmart Grooming Service](https://services-staging.petsmart.com/) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The framework is built with TypeScript and follows the Page Object Model (POM) to enhance code maintainability and reusability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher).
- **Git**: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install project dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environments

In `config/config.ts`, define environment-specific settings such as:
- **`baseUrl`**: The base URL for the application.
- **`groomingUrl`**: URL for grooming-related tests.
- **`credentials`**: Username and password for login.

Each environment (e.g., `qa`, `staging`, `production`) has a separate configuration, and the default environment is set to `qa`.

### 4. Setting Up Authentication (auth.json)

For tests that require a logged-in session:
```bash
npm run tests:e2e-suite
```

### 5. Running Tests

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run tests:e2e-suite
  ```

- **Run a specific test**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/e2e/e2e-dog-grooming-flow.spec.ts
  ```


<!-- ### 6. Viewing Test Reports

Playwright generates HTML reports for each test run. To view a comprehensive test report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
``` -->


### Project Structure

- **`page-objects/`**: Contains Page Object Model (POM) classes for different pages.
- **`tests/`**: Stores test cases, organized by feature or flow.
- **`config/`**: Holds environment configuration files and session management files like `auth.json`.
- **`auth.json`**: Stores session data for pre-authenticated tests.
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Main configuration file for Playwright, where global test settings are specified.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: This framework organizes page-specific locators and methods into reusable classes, allowing for better code management.
- **Environment Configurations**: Easily switch between `qa`, `staging`, and `production` environments using `config/config.ts`.
- **Authentication Handling**: `auth.json` allows you to maintain session states without repeated logins.
- **Robust Reporting**: Access detailed reports and trace files for analyzing test results and troubleshooting.

## Additional Resources

- [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Slow Performance**: Increase Playwrightâ€™s default timeout in `playwright.config.ts` or use `page.waitForTimeout(ms)` between actions.
- **Request Failures**: If requests are failing frequently, check network throttling settings and implement retry logic.
- **Environment-Specific Bugs**: Verify that `baseUrl` and `credentials` in `config/config.ts` match the target environment.

This framework is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for UI automation, with a focus on scalability, reusability, and ease of maintenance.
